"""Regression tests for a path-traversal-shaped pattern found in a
follow-up security audit: both anetbbs/features/ansi_ui.py's
load_menu_ansi() and anetbbs/core/session.py's _show_ansi_screen()
join a `slot` string directly into a filesystem path with no character
validation. `slot` can originate from a sysop-controlled free-text
field -- games.py's _show_category_submenu() builds
f'door_games_{category}' straight from Game.category (set via the web
admin door-game editor, never slugified), and menu_engine.py's 'ansi'
action passes a menu item's action_args (also sysop free text)
straight into _show_ansi_screen(). Neither was ever validated against
'..'/'/' before reaching the path join.

Gated entirely behind sysop-level admin access already (not a
privilege escalation on its own), but a real, concrete defense-in-
depth gap: a sysop who set a category/action_args to something like
'../../../../etc/passwd' could get its bytes read and sent to a user's
terminal as "art". Fixed by restricting slot to [A-Za-z0-9_-] -- every
real slot name already matches that character set, so this can't break
any legitimate caller.
