        inline category blocks, just scoped to one category and with
        'B'/'Q' returning to the parent door menu instead of the main
        menu. Deliberately one level deep only -- a submenu category's
        own games are always shown flat here, no further nesting.

        Paginated: a category with more entries than fit on one screen
        (real live bug reported 2026-09-01 -- a 100+-game category from
        the A-Net Game Server bulk import ran off the bottom of a fixed-
        height terminal with no way to see the rest) shows one page at a
        time with [N]ext/[P]rev navigation, matching this codebase's
        existing --MORE-- pagination convention (see bbs_ui.py's
        _page_lines). Numbering stays absolute across pages (game #47 is
        always #47, whichever page it's currently showing on) so a
        remembered number always picks the same game.

        Custom art: checked under the slot name `door_games_<category-
        slug>` (e.g. a category with slug "synchronet-doors" looks for
        data/text/menus/door_games_synchronet-doors.ans), mirroring the
        top-level door menu's own `door_games` slot -- falls back to
        this generated layout if no matching file exists. Custom art is
        only ever shown for page 1 (art is a fixed, hand-drawn screen --
        there's no per-page variant of it), later pages always use the
        generated layout. See docs/04-ansi-screens.md's slot-names

    GAMES inside an as_submenu=True category's own submenu page: real
    live feedback, confirmed directly -- Jerry has no existing hand-
    drawn ANSI art for any category submenu page ("I do not have the
    sub-menus ansi because the numbers kept changing"), specifically
    BECAUSE this class of bug made it pointless to build one. With no
    art to protect, a submenu's games get the exact same treatment
    categories themselves already get below: always resequenced to a
    clean 1, 2, 3, ... run on every boot, not just when a literal
    collision exists -- otherwise a category that happened to already
    be collision-FREE-but-gappy (e.g. "0, 10, 20, 30, ..." -- the
    result of an EARLIER version of this same function, which only
    bumped genuine duplicates) would never reach a clean state at all,
    confirmed live: ADULT and CHAT/Apps/Other stayed at "0, 10, 20..."
    forever while ADVENTURE (still a live collision) got fixed, an
    inconsistent, confusing result across categories a sysop is
    looking at side by side.

    GAMES NOT inside an as_submenu category (an inline category's own
    games, shown directly at the top level, or a game with no category
    at all) keep the OLD, more conservative collision-only rule
    instead: a sysop's own deliberately-chosen number can be hardcoded
    into the TOP-LEVEL door-menu art screen (see show_door_menu()'s own
    big comment) -- and unlike submenu pages, Jerry has NOT said that
    top-level art doesn't currently exist, so this stays narrow there:
    only a GENUINE duplicate gets touched, and even then only the
    duplicates are bumped to a free value, not a full resequence.

    CATEGORIES: unlike games, a category's own number isn't something
    a sysop hardcodes into per-door ANSI art -- it's a short,
    sysop-curated navigational list, and real live feedback (repeated
    across several rounds: "numbers should start at 1") made clear
    categories don't carry games' same "never reshuffle" expectation.
    So every as_submenu=True category that currently shows a numbered
    stand-in line at all (has at least one visible active game -- an
    empty/invisible category would otherwise silently waste a number
    the same way an inline category used to, before that was fixed)
    gets resequenced to a clean 1, 2, 3, ... run on every boot,
    preserving whatever relative order the sysop already dragged them
    into -- this only ever cleans up the NUMBER label, drag-and-drop
    still fully controls the actual order."""
